Troubleshooting
---------------

First, try running this Terminal command:

```
rm -rf "~/Library/Application Support/Coda 2/Plug-ins/WakaTime.codaplugin/Contents/Resources/wakatime-master"
```

Then restart Coda.

If that doesn't work, turn on debug mode and check your Coda log file (`/var/log/system.log`) and your wakatime cli log file (`~/.wakatime.log`).
